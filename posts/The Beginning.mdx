Yesterday, I was listening to a podcast by Brian Douglas, founder and CEO of Open Sauced. In his early days, he started a blog similar to the blog you're reading right now.
Where, he used to post a blog every day, mentioning what he learnt. I got inspired from him and the result is this blog.

I'll be writing my learnings here.

## The Project

I've forked this NextJS/TS/Tailwind project from this [repository](https://github.com/ChangoMan/nextjs-typescript-mdx-blog) by Hunter Chang. I'll modifying it to my taste.
