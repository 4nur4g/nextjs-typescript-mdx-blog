title: Tailwind, Grid and NextJS
description: How I had to research on Tailwind grid, NextJS and other aspects.

Today, I further analysed this project. I decided to add an intro component on the homepage. The idea is that the component should persist while going to a different route, except the blog or `[slug].tsx` route.

The intro component required the use of flexbox or grid. I decided to go with the latter.

For making columns in Tailwind, I could use `grid grid-cols-2`, or in CSS `grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr));`

However, I wanted to the width of the first column to be of the image. Using the previous code, two columns are created, with equal width each.

After some searching, I came across a stack overflow answer on the same question. Finally, I used `className="grid grid-cols-[max-content_max-content] gap-3"`

Here's the final result. I'll modify it over time.

<div className="grid grid-cols-[max-content_max-content] gap-3">
  <Image
    className="rounded-lg"
    src={'/images/anurag.jpg'}
    width={150}
    height={150}
  />
  <div className="self-end">
    <h1 className="m-0 font-semibold text-2xl">Anuarg Pradhan</h1>
    <p className="m-0">Full stack/Android developer</p>
    <p className="m-0">Documenting my journey here</p>
  </div>
</div>

In order to persist this component on route change, I had to fiddle with the project structure, so that I could wrap layouts in `_app.tsx` file. However, the project structure wasn't like that. Layouts weren't used in the \_app file.

Therefore, I restructured the code by making components like Header, Footer, Blog, and placing them in \_app file.

When I checked the dev server, boom, seemed like mdx files weren't being read. On further investigation, I found out that `page` component wasn't receiving `posts` as props from `getStaticProps`. Strangely, getStaticProps did produce the data, but it wasn't taken up by the page component, which received posts as undefined.

On further search, again, stack overflow came to the reque. The problem was, while modifying the `_app.tsx` file, I removed props from the component, component. It caused the issue.

Also, I thought about one more requirement, I wanted the intro component to be rendered with home and about page, but not posts page. I consulted the [next documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts).

The solution was to use component.getLayout function and then, in `_app.tsx` file, conditionally checking everything. The code looks like this:

```tsx:pages/index.js
import Layout from '../components/layout'
import NestedLayout from '../components/nested-layout'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    /** Your content */
  )
}

Page.getLayout = function getLayout(page) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <NestedLayout>{page}</NestedLayout>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

```tsx:pages/_app.js
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  // Use the layout defined at the page level, if available
  const getLayout = Component.getLayout || ((page) => page);

  return getLayout(<Component {...pageProps} />);
}
```

Other then that, I learned more about Next themes. How Tailwind works with it. But, one thing is still unclear. How dark/light theme is managed by the two. The process. I wasn't able to find the information. I'll search more on it later.

Those were main learning for today.
